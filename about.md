A thorough description: Simple blog about computational statistics.

This blog is generated using Jekyll. It has no shiny buttons, no social media zig-zag and no eye-candy that would distract you from the math and the code. What it does have is support for $$\LaTeX$$ and RMarkdown, which greatly reduce the effort of creating reproducible research.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
